         Dummy Text As in previous assignment, the rest of your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/”lorem ipsum”, it doesn’t matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use the Bootstrap Grid we discussed in Lecture 26 of Module 2 as well as numerous lectures of Module 3, including Lecture 35.)


         Each section should be fairly large in height. You can achieve this by either filling it up with a lot of content text or simply setting its height property to something large like 700px. At the end of each section, provide a link that says “Back to Top”. This link should jump the page back to “Our Menu” heading. 

        (Hint: use a link that points to a section of the page discussed in Lecture 9 of Module 1.) 


         Each section should have an h3-based section heading which should be centered within the section. Use the same Bootstrap class you used for centering the page heading to center the section heading. Use the heading names shown in the mockup illustrations, i.e., “Chicken”, “Beef”, “Sushi”.


         Layout: In the desktop view, each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower.
